## :blush: **Why?**

Animavita is a combination of two Latin words, ‘Animal’ and ‘Vitae’, which means respectively ‘Animal’ and ‘Life’. This is an idea to create or animate something that was born a while ago, when I realized that facebook is used to publicize adoption and also ask for help for animals that lives on the streets.

Animavita's purpose is not to change how people use facebook to the activities described above, but to centralize the helpful information in a single application. Anyone can make an adoption request, but it doesn’t mean that the pet will be automatically adopted. It means that the person interested can talk to the person who registered the pet, allowing both sides to have a conversation, and the user to research and decide his favorite pet.

## :dizzy: **Roadmap**

Check the Roadmap to more details about itens below.

-   [ ] Rescue system (WIP)
-   [ ] Write CONTRIBUTING.md + Install instructions
-   [ ] Make it work on IOS
-   [ ] Write tests in backend
-   [ ] Write tests in frontend
-   [ ] Transform into responsive
-   [ ] Create Landing Page
-   [ ] i18n
-   [ ] Offline-first
-   [ ] Create/Apply Dataloaders
-   [ ] Update to latest React Native version

## **Install instructions**

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://github.com/wendelfreitas/animavita`
- 1.2) `cd animavita` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with `yarn install`
        **Note:** NPM has issues with React Native so `yarn` is recommended over `npm`.

#### 2) Start your app

- 2.1) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `yarn ios`. The first build will take some time.
- 2.2) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `yarn android` from the root of your project.
